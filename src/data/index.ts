    title: "How to Save 26% With the Federal Tax Credit in 2022",
    excerpt:
      "The Federal Tax Credit is going away more and more each year. As of right now in 2022, it's set at 26%. For any taxpayer, anything you do to upgrade to renewable energy can be included! This means your solar installation, any light ugprades, smart thermostats, insulation, reroofing, batteries, generators and more can be included. This Tax Credit might go away at the end of the year, in 2023, because it must go up for renewable. There's a chance that it'll either end, or go down to 20%. Don't wait around to claim this tax credit. Save yourself from getting price gouged by your Utility provider and claim your Tax Credit with Your Local Solar Experts.",

    excerpt:
      "Are solar panels actually worth it? It's one of the most common questions I get, ahd the answer is a resounding YES! Not only are solar panels going to help you completely eliminate or massively offset your energy bill, but you'll build tens of thousands of dollars in equity in your home with your installation!",

    excerpt:
      "Have you heard of Solar Renewable Energy Credits? It's a really awesome benefit that comes with solar installations in certain states. One of the states that offers SRECs is Virginia! An SREC is sort of like an options contract, for your energy. You're allowed to sell the credit at any time, for cash, in a fluctuating market. Wait till the time is right, and reduce your solar bill by up to $100/year!",

    excerpt:
      "Unfortunately, some states like Hawai'i, California and Nevada have either eliminated Net Metering entirely, or drastically reduced the rate at which you get the energy you share with the grid back when you need it. Luckily in states like Virgnia, you can stil claim the 1-1 tier. Meaning in the summer when you produce electricity like crazy, you'll get credited back that energy when you need it, 1-1, in the winter!",
